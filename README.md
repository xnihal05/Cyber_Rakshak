## 🚨 The Problem
Modern Smart Cities and Government Offices are vulnerable. A single compromised IoT device (like a smart bulb or printer) can act as a gateway for attackers to breach critical infrastructure. Traditional firewalls are often too expensive or complex for local deployment.

## 💡 The Solution: Cyber-Rakshak
**Cyber-Rakshak** is an indigenous, AI-powered **Edge Security Node** designed to protect local networks. It doesn't just block attacks; it actively deceives hackers using **Generative AI Decoys**.

### 🚀 Key Features
* ** AI Threat Detection:** Uses an **Isolation Forest** model to detect behavioral anomalies in real-time.
* ** Active Deception:** Automatically generates and uploads **Fake Data** (decoy passwords/SQL dumps) to the attacker, wasting their time and resources.
* ** Kernel Kill Switch:** A human-operated button that physically severs the connection at the OS level (using `iptables`/`netsh`).
* ** Real-Time Threat Map:** Visualizes attack origins and targets on a live 3D globe.
* ** Forensic Logging:** Auto-generates "Top Secret" incident reports for legal and forensic analysis.

##  Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python)
* **Backend:** Scapy (Packet Sniffing), Pandas (Data Processing)
* **AI Model:** Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest)
* **Visualization:** Plotly Express & Graph Objects
