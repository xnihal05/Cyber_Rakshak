**Team Dimension Drifters** | *Nihal Singh, Ankit Thakur, Yashmeen Paul, Sneha Rani*

##  The Problem
IoT devices (Smart Bulbs, Cameras) are the weakest link in home security( specially in India, due to cheap price attraction for middle class). Attackers use them to move laterally into private networks, bypassing traditional firewalls.

##  Our Solution
**Cyber-Rakshak** is an AI-powered "Digital Watchtower" that detects malicious traffic signatures in real-time using Unsupervised Learning (Isolation Forest).

##  Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Real-time War Room Dashboard)
* **Backend:** Python + Scapy (Packet Sniffing)
* **AI Engine:** Scikit-Learn (Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection)
* **Visualization:** Plotly & Pandas

##  How to Run
1.  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  `python -m streamlit run app.py`
